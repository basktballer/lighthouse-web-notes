#Week 1 Day 2 Notes
## Lecture Notes
* node debug array.js

  * n - next
  * c - continue
  * REPL -> node to view variables in line at breaks

* node --inspect-brk arrays.js
  * chrome://inspect

## Exercises
* Truthey Falsey
  * // All of the following are inherently falsey:

  * False
  * // False is False. Makes sense, right?

  * 0
  * // 0 is the only falsey Number

  * ""
  * // an empty string is falsey

  * null
  * // a null, or empty value, is falsey.

  * undefined
  * // an object that has not been defined is considered falsey.

  * NaN
  * // Not a Number. You'll learn more about NaN as we go on.

  * {}
  * // an empty object is a truthey.

* let is block specific

## Afternoon Breakout

* Cockroach.db read and learn about data base, open source library reading to learn how to do things

* var -> lexically scoped, ignores braces unless they are functions, otherwise part of global scope still
