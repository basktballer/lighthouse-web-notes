    * Incredibly important
    * Don't code on master ever
    * Won't be able to undo it if you make a mistake
    * Nothing merged into master unless it works
    * Branch to share non working code on
    * Dev branch off of master
    * Pull request 
      * People reviewing and Q/A work
      * Check out locally, run application, make sure it works
      * Write in description of request
      * What to test to make it work
    * Then merge to master
    * Then everyone pulls
  * Scaffolding
    * Sit together to set up project
    * How everything works together

    * Recommend keep it divided by user story

    * Divide a feature into 2
    * Add a new restaurant
      * Back end work, front end work
    * Root division by feature
  * Don't ever have more than one thing in progress for you
    * Branch has much more than that is bad
